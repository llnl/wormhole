# Wormhole UI

## Development

Start the token service, the route registry, and their dependencies (from this directory):

```
docker compose up
```

The token-service API is then available at `http://localhost:5000` (override with
`TOKEN_SERVICE_PORT`), and the route-registry API at `http://localhost:5001` (override with
`ROUTE_REGISTRY_PORT`).

Run the UI against them:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI dev server runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/token-service` and
`/route-registry` to the backends above.

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

Playwright/Chromium tests that mock the token-service and route-registry APIs, so no backend is
needed. The mocks, models, and repositories are typed against `src/token-service-api-types.ts` and
`src/route-registry-api-types.ts`, generated from each service's OpenAPI spec via
`npm run gen:api-types` (needs both backends running). `npm run gen:token-service-api-types` and
`npm run gen:route-registry-api-types` regenerate one at a time. `npm run check:api-types` fails if
regenerating either produces a diff.

```
npm run test:integration
```

Runs the token-service flows against a real token service instead of mocks (start it first, per
above). Assumes the database is empty and restores that state afterward, so it runs alone and
serially.
